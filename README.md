<h1> Testing SKD for Github API </h1>


----

*My task was to create something on the border of the client or SDK for GitHub API,
i.e. a library that would facilitate the use of available solutions.*


-------

<h3>What did I use in the project? What have I learned?</h3>

* What is [GITHUB API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest)
* I found out what a [Personal Token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) I could use. 
* What is the TDD methodology, i.e. red-green-refactor 
* I learned here how to write unit tests

*TDD methodology, i.e. red-green-refactor.
First, you write tests that you have to configure yourself.
Only then do you write the implementation.
Let your tests determine what functionality your library will have*

*GITHUB API: 
The documentation is based on the examples for curl. I had to translate it into java script 

(this [DOCUMENTACTION](https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/docapis_understand_curl.html  helped: https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/docapis_understand_curl.html) helped)



Thanks to GITHUB API, we can, for example:
* download user information 

* download information about repositories 

* get information about commits in the repository 

* download information about commit comments 

* download information about errors in the repository 

(This is what I used in my project and the tests passed)

<h3>How to open a file? :eyes: </h3>

* On the right side you will find the "clone or download" button - click it.
* An item should appear with the "Download ZIP" option - click again.
* Now you just need to unpack the downloaded file and open it in your favorite editor.
* you must enter the appropriate folder (command "cd" + file name, e.g. task-js-testing) 
* you must to install all packages via npm install
* then you can : npm test
